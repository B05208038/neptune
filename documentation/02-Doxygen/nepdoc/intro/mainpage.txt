@section Introduction
  Within the Network Partnering Initiative (NPI) between ESA/ESOC and TU Braunschweig, the orbit propagation tool NEPTUNE (NPI Ephemeris Propagation Tool with Uncertainty Extrapolation) is being developed. The initial orbit state, which consists of the radius and velocity vector as well as the variance/covariance matrix of an object, is numerically integrated using a variable-step multi-step double integration method. Perturbative accelerations due to the Earth's geopotential, the Earth's atmosphere, lunisolar gravitational perturbations, solar and Earth radiation pressure, as well as tides are considered.

  NEPTUNE also provides the means to simulate oriented surfaces and the application of additional accelerations (e.g. maneuvers), which are not provided by the perturbations force model.
