\section{Overview}

One of the key elements of a space surveillance system is the propagation technique used in the orbit determination process. While the first surveillance systems in the \acrshort{acr:us} and the Soviet Union 
employed fast analytical techniques, also known as \gls{acr:gp} methods, with today's computational limitations virtually non-existing, it is common to use so-called \gls{acr:sp} techniques, 
which perform the numerical integration of a detailed force model. The numerical propagation tool \neptune (\acrlong{acr:neptune}) was designed to be used in the context of a space surveillance system and is described in detail in the following.

The first step was to define the required force model and select state-of-the-art methods that would be implemented to meet the need in the intended context. Therefore, besides a 3 \gls{acr:dof} propagation for the state vector, \neptune has also 
the capability to propagate the covariance matrix, which is an essential step in the filtering process within the statistical orbit determination. Finally, the concept of 
including time-correlated (coloured) noise into the filtering application was studied in detail and shall be presented here, based on the work of 
\citet{nazarenko2010}.

The coordinate and time systems implemented in \neptune are based on the \gls{acr:iau} recommendations and will be outlined in \sect{sec:propagation-coordinates}. Especially the 
conversion from the inertial to the Earth-fixed frame and vice versa is computationally expensive, so that a method has been devised to significantly improve 
computation speed without significant performance loss.

It is possible to define the shape of the satellite used in a \neptune propagation with a very simple geometry, which shall be described in 
\sect{sec:propagation-satellite-model}. That approach served as a simple method to simulate box-wing configurations in the validation of \neptune (see \cha{cha:validation}).

The numerical integrator and the force model will be given in detail in \sect{sec:propagation-state}, while the details for the covariance matrix propagation are provided in 
\sect{sec:propagation-covariance}.

Finally, the process noise, which results in additional contributions to the covariance propagation due to uncertainties in the force model, will be detailed in \sect{sec:noise}. 
Different methods to incorporate noise into filtering applications shall be described with a focus on coloured noise, as especially the geopotential shows significant time-correlations.
